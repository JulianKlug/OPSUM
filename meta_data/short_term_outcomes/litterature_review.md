# Early Neurological Deterioration after Acute Ischemic Stroke: Literature Review

## Prevalence of Early Neurological Deterioration in Acute Ischemic Stroke  
Reported prevalence of END after AIS varies widely in the literature, largely due to differences in END definitions, timing, and populations studied ([Identifying the Risk Factors of Early Neurological Deterioration After Thrombolysis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke | 2022, Volume 28 - Issue 3 |  Turkish Journal of Neurology](https://tjn.org.tr/full-text/92/eng#:~:text=Early%20neurological%20deterioration%20,8)). Overall, approximately one in five stroke patients experiences early worsening, although published rates range from under 10% to as high as 40% in different cohorts ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=patients%2C%2021%20patients%20%2820.8,because%20of%20cardiac%20arrest%2C%20one)). A meta-analysis of lacunar stroke (small-vessel occlusion) found incidence rates from 2.3% up to 47.5% across studies, with a pooled estimate of about 23.5% ([Early neurological deterioration in acute lacunar ischemic stroke: Systematic review of incidence, mechanisms, and prospects for treatment - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39086233/#:~:text=timescale%20for%20END%20varied%20from,NIHSS%29%20decreases%20of%20%E2%A9%BE1)) – reflecting heterogeneity in criteria (e.g. any NIHSS increase vs. larger changes). In general stroke populations, most studies cite END in roughly 20–30% of patients ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=patients%2C%2021%20patients%20%2820.8,because%20of%20cardiac%20arrest%2C%20one)). For example, Kwan and Hand (2006) reported END as a “frequent complication” occurring in roughly one-quarter of strokes, with a poor short-term prognosis ([Early neurological deterioration in acute stroke - Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/99/9/625/2258960#:~:text=Academic%20academic,term%20prognosis)). A large contemporary multicenter study in China (n=9,114) observed END (defined as NIHSS increase ≥2 or ≥1 in motor function within 7 days) in 14.1% of patients ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%209114%20patients,at%2090%20days%2C%20and%20the)). Notably, in that cohort the majority of END cases (62.5%) occurred within the first 24 hours of admission ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%209114%20patients,at%2090%20days%2C%20and%20the)), highlighting that the highest risk period for deterioration is the first day after stroke onset ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A)).

**Stroke Subtype and Severity:** The risk of END is not uniform across stroke subtypes. More severe strokes and those due to large artery occlusions tend to have higher deterioration rates. In the classic Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, total anterior circulation infarcts (large cortical strokes) showed the highest END frequency (~42% deteriorated within 7 days), whereas partial anterior circulation infarcts (more limited cortical strokes) had much lower rates (~6%) ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke in 4 clinical categories classified by the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10978028/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20subjects%20comprised,were%20lower%20in%20the%20D)). Lacunar infarcts (small deep strokes) and posterior circulation infarcts had intermediate END frequencies (approximately 21–26%) ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke in 4 clinical categories classified by the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10978028/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20subjects%20comprised,were%20lower%20in%20the%20D)). These findings from Tei et al. (2000) illustrate that extensive strokes affecting large territories are at greatest risk of early worsening, while small subcortical strokes, despite often mild initial deficits, still have a notable risk (around 15–25% in various studies) ([Early neurological deterioration in acute lacunar ischemic stroke: Systematic review of incidence, mechanisms, and prospects for treatment - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39086233/#:~:text=Background%3A%20%20Cerebral%20small%20vessel,mechanisms%20are%20not%20well%20understood)) ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke in 4 clinical categories classified by the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10978028/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20subjects%20comprised,were%20lower%20in%20the%20D)). Another early study by Dávalos et al. (1990) found a remarkably high deterioration rate of 40.8% within the first 48 hours among patients presenting within 8 hours of stroke (many with large anterior circulation strokes) ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke: risk factors and prognosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2247235/#:~:text=To%20determine%20a%20risk%20profile,the%20end%20of%20the%20study)). The wide range of END prevalence in the literature (≈5% to 40%) is thus explained by differences in stroke severity mix, etiology, and how deterioration is defined and measured. Table 1 summarizes major studies reporting END prevalence across various settings and patient populations.

**Impact of Stroke Unit Care:** Importantly, the level of care can influence observed END rates. Patients managed in dedicated stroke units with close monitoring may have fewer or less severe deteriorations. Roquer et al. (2008) demonstrated that monitored *acute stroke unit* (ASU) care was associated with a reduced risk of END and improved 90-day outcomes ([Acute stroke unit care and early neurological deterioration ... - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18712428/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,admitted%20to%20monitored%20stroke%20units)). Frequent neurological assessments in a stroke unit allow rapid detection and management of complications, which can prevent minor declines from evolving into major neurological worsening ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20findings%20of,close%20monitoring%20and%20rapid%20interventions)). Indeed, one analysis concluded that vigilant monitoring in an ASU is the most effective measure to prevent END ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20findings%20of,close%20monitoring%20and%20rapid%20interventions)). This underscores that reported END rates from older studies (when stroke unit care was less prevalent) might be higher than in modern practice with specialized stroke units.

**Timing of END:** When END occurs, it is typically early. Many studies note that END events cluster in the first 24–48 hours post-stroke ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%209114%20patients,at%2090%20days%2C%20and%20the)) ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=patients%2C%2021%20patients%20%2820.8,because%20of%20cardiac%20arrest%2C%20one)). For instance, in the Chinese multicenter study, nearly two-thirds of deteriorations happened on the first day ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%209114%20patients,at%2090%20days%2C%20and%20the)). Similarly, Weimar et al. (2005) observed that most neurologic worsening in their cohort occurred within 72 hours of admission ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=patients%2C%2021%20patients%20%2820.8,because%20of%20cardiac%20arrest%2C%20one)). After about the first week, further neurological worsening is usually considered *late deterioration* or related to other medical complications rather than the acute stroke process itself. The operational definitions of “early” in END vary (24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, or through hospital week one), but all emphasize the immediate post-stroke period as the critical window.

**Outcomes of END:** Patients who experience END have consistently poorer outcomes than those who remain stable or improve. Deterioration often portends a larger final infarct or additional injury. Multiple studies have shown higher mortality and disability in the END group ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke: risk factors and prognosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2247235/#:~:text=Barthel%20index%20during%20a%20follow,from%20the%204th%20day%20onward)) ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke in 4 clinical categories classified by the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10978028/#:~:text=significant%20stenoses%20in%20corresponding%20arteries,with%20TACI%2C%20LACI%2C%20and%20POCI)). For example, Dávalos et al. found a 35% mortality in patients with deteriorating strokes vs. 8.6% in non-deteriorating strokes at 3 months ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke: risk factors and prognosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2247235/#:~:text=Barthel%20index%20during%20a%20follow,from%20the%204th%20day%20onward)). Tei et al. reported that in the END group of large anterior strokes, mortality exceeded 35%, and functional independence was markedly lower compared to those without END ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke in 4 clinical categories classified by the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10978028/#:~:text=significant%20stenoses%20in%20corresponding%20arteries,with%20TACI%2C%20LACI%2C%20and%20POCI)). Thus, END is a strong negative prognostic indicator, which is why early identification of patients at risk is so important.

## Risk Factors Associated with END  
Identifying risk factors for END has been a major focus of research, as these factors shed light on the mechanisms of deterioration and help clinicians recognize high-risk patients. END is a multifactorial phenomenon – **patient clinical characteristics, stroke-specific factors (size, location, etiology), and various physiological and laboratory parameters** all contribute. Broadly, risk factors for END can be categorized as clinical, imaging-related, or laboratory-based (Table 2). We summarize key risk factors below by category:

### Clinical Factors  
- **Stroke Severity at Onset:** One of the strongest predictors of END is the initial stroke severity. Patients with a high NIHSS score on admission are much more likely to worsen. A 2013 cohort study found baseline NIHSS was independently associated with END ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=match%20at%20L227%20AIS,11%20END%20is%20also)), and many risk models include NIHSS as a key component ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=been%20proposed%2C%20but%20none%20of,the%20risk%20of%20developing%20END)) ([Frontiers | A predictive model for early neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1477286/full#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20we%20developed,model%20showed%20good%20discriminatory%20and)). Severe strokes presumably have a larger vulnerable ischemic penumbra that can progress if not reperfused. In contrast, minor strokes (low NIHSS) have less area to potentially deteriorate, though they are not immune to END (especially if a large vessel occlusion underlies the mild exam, as discussed below).  
- **Age and Comorbidities:** Higher age has been linked to greater END risk in several studies ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=of%20END%20occurred%20within%2024,CI%3A%201.53%E2%80%931.97)) ([Identifying the Risk Factors of Early Neurological Deterioration After Thrombolysis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke | 2022, Volume 28 - Issue 3 |  Turkish Journal of Neurology](https://tjn.org.tr/full-text/92/eng#:~:text=Results%3A%20Age%20%28p%3D0,0.001)). Older patients may have less cerebrovascular reserve and more systemic vulnerabilities. Comorbid conditions like **diabetes mellitus** (and resultant hyperglycemia) are consistently associated with early worsening ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=of%20END%20occurred%20within%2024,CI%3A%201.53%E2%80%931.97)) ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke: risk factors and prognosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2247235/#:~:text=Barthel%20index%20during%20a%20follow,from%20the%204th%20day%20onward)). In fact, hyperglycemia on admission is a well-established risk factor; in one meta-analysis, elevated glucose was associated with increased odds of END ([

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is another important factor – patients with AF-related cardioembolic strokes often experience early re-embolization or growth of the thrombus if not anticoagulated, leading to sudden neurologic declines ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=of%20END%20occurred%20within%2024,as%20independent%20predictors%20for%20END)). Cardioembolic strokes in general carry an END risk due to the potential for new emboli or hemorrhagic transformation. History of prior stroke or baseline disability has also been identified as increasing END risk ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=of%20END%20occurred%20within%2024,CI%3A%201.53%E2%80%931.97)), possibly reflecting reduced neurological reserve.  
- **Blood Pressure Dynamics:** Both elevated and excessively lowered blood pressure can contribute to END. Dávalos et al. (1990) first showed that *high systolic blood pressure* on admission was independently related to stroke deterioration ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke: risk factors and prognosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2247235/#:~:text=Barthel%20index%20during%20a%20follow,from%20the%204th%20day%20onward)). Very high BP might promote edema or hemorrhagic transformation, whereas on the other hand, aggressive BP reduction or hypotension can reduce perfusion to the penumbra, causing neurologic decline. Some studies have noted END predictors such as early systolic BP drop or hypotension in the acute phase ([Early neurological deterioration in acute ischaemic stroke - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18832401/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,mellitus%2C%20hypotension%2C%20and%20atrial%20fibrillation)). Overall, careful blood pressure management is warranted: extreme hypertension or hypotension are both undesirable in acute stroke.  
- **Fever (Hyperthermia):** Elevated body temperature in the first 24 hours is associated with early neurological worsening. Hyperthermia exacerbates ischemic injury by increasing metabolic demand and promoting inflammation. A study by Castillo et al. (1998) found that for each 1°C increase in body temperature in the first day, the risk of early stroke deterioration rose significantly ([Body Temperature and Fibrinogen Are Related to Early ...](https://karger.com/ced/article/7/2/64/58920/Body-Temperature-and-Fibrinogen-Are-Related-to#:~:text=Body%20Temperature%20and%20Fibrinogen%20Are,%C2%B0C%20increase%20in%20body)). Fever within 24 hours was an independent predictor of END alongside fibrinogen in that study. Conversely, low-normal temperatures may be neuroprotective; therapeutic hypothermia has been explored as a way to reduce stroke progression (though not yet standard).  
- **Other Medical Factors:** Early complications such as infection (e.g. aspiration pneumonia) or cardiac arrhythmias can indirectly cause neurological decline. Seizures in the acute phase of stroke can mimic or cause transient worsening. These medical issues often need to be excluded or managed when evaluating a patient for END. Prophylaxis and vigilant monitoring for such complications are part of stroke unit protocols to mitigate their impact.  

### Imaging and Stroke-Specific Factors  
- **Large Vessel Occlusion and Collateral Failure:** Perhaps the most critical stroke-specific predictor of END is the presence of an *ongoing large artery occlusion*. Occlusion of proximal cerebral arteries (internal carotid, proximal middle cerebral artery [MCA], etc.) with poor collateral circulation often leads to progressive ischemia. In one analysis, large artery atherosclerotic stroke subtype carried a substantially higher risk of END than cardioembolic or small-vessel strokes (57% of END cases were large-artery vs. 16% in non-END) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=match%20at%20L227%20AIS,11%20END%20is%20also)). Failure to recanalize a major occlusion (either spontaneously or via therapy) can result in stroke extension. In thrombolyzed patients, *inadequate or delayed recanalization* of a large vessel was found to be the most common cause of END, more so than hemorrhagic complications ([Identifying the Risk Factors of Early Neurological Deterioration After Thrombolysis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke | 2022, Volume 28 - Issue 3 |  Turkish Journal of Neurology](https://tjn.org.tr/full-text/92/eng#:~:text=variables%20were%20found%20to%20be,0.001)). This underscores that persistent vessel occlusion and clot propagation are central mechanisms.  
- **Infarct Size and Early CT Signs:** Larger infarct core volume correlates with higher risk of edema and neurologic decline. On baseline imaging, surrogates for large infarct such as a low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on head CT predict END. In thrombolysis-treated patients, a low ASPECTS (meaning more extensive early ischemic changes) was a strong independent predictor of deterioration ([Identifying the Risk Factors of Early Neurological Deterioration After Thrombolysis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke | 2022, Volume 28 - Issue 3 |  Turkish Journal of Neurology](https://tjn.org.tr/full-text/92/eng#:~:text=Results%3A%20Age%20%28p%3D0,0.001)). Tei et al. (2000) found that in large anterior strokes, early CT changes (signs of infarction or swelling) were significantly more frequent in those who went on to deteriorate ([Deteriorating ischemic stroke in 4 clinical categories classified by the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10978028/#:~:text=%2825.7,patients%20with%20TACI%20and%20POCI)). These imaging findings likely indicate a sizable area of threatened brain that can worsen without sufficient perfusion.  
- **Stroke Location and Territory:** As noted with OCSP subtypes, the location of the stroke matters. *Brainstem strokes* (part of posterior circulation) can acutely worsen due to edema in a confined space or extension to vital centers. *Lacunar (deep) strokes* sometimes deteriorate due to strategic location (e.g., internal capsule) where a small expansion causes major deficits, or due to growth of the small perforator artery clot. *Borderzone (watershed) infarcts* were also identified as a risk factor in one large study ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=of%20END%20occurred%20within%2024,as%20independent%20predictors%20for%20END)), possibly because they indicate hemodynamic compromise that can fluctuate. In Liu et al. (2023), infarcts in the lenticulostriate artery territory (deep MCA perforators) or in watershed zones were independently predictive of END ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=of%20END%20occurred%20within%2024,as%20independent%20predictors%20for%20END)). Those locations may reflect either small-vessel disease prone to progression (for lacunar) or systemic hypoperfusion for watershed.  
- **Hemorrhagic Transformation:** Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after thrombolytic therapy is a well-known cause of early neurological worsening. While relatively infrequent (~5% of IV tPA-treated patients), sICH can cause abrupt and severe neurological decline typically within 24–36 hours of treatment. Interestingly, in thrombolyzed cohorts, hemorrhagic transformation is not the most common cause of END – failure of reperfusion is more common ([Identifying the Risk Factors of Early Neurological Deterioration After Thrombolysis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke | 2022, Volume 28 - Issue 3 |  Turkish Journal of Neurology](https://tjn.org.tr/full-text/92/eng#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20The%20causes%20of%20END,inadequate%20recanalization%20or%20late%20recanalization)) – but when it occurs, it often meets END criteria. Risk factors specifically for hemorrhagic transformation (e.g. very high BP, large infarct, anticoagulation) therefore indirectly are risk factors for END in thrombolysis patients ([Identifying the Risk Factors of Early Neurological Deterioration After Thrombolysis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke | 2022, Volume 28 - Issue 3 |  Turkish Journal of Neurology](https://tjn.org.tr/full-text/92/eng#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20The%20causes%20of%20END,inadequate%20recanalization%20or%20late%20recanalization)). Clinically, distinguishing hemorrhagic vs ischemic causes of END requires urgent imaging.  
- **Other Imaging Factors:** *Cerebral edema* leading to raised intracranial pressure can cause gradual deterioration (often between 24 hours and 5 days post-stroke, peaking at ~3–5 days for large infarcts). Weimar et al. (2005) found ~27% of END cases were attributed to edema/herniation in a large series ([Neurologic worsening during the acute phase of ischemic stroke](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15767504/#:~:text=stroke%20pubmed,3)). Edema risk is tied to infarct size and location (e.g., malignant MCA infarction). Additionally, certain imaging biomarkers like poor collaterals on angiography or diffusion-perfusion mismatch patterns on MRI have been studied as predictors of stroke expansion and END ([Prediction of Early Neurological Deterioration Using Diffusion](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.str.0000027861.75884.df#:~:text=Prediction%20of%20Early%20Neurological%20Deterioration,stroke%20patients%20and%20is)). These advanced imaging factors are not yet in routine use for prediction models but are being investigated.  

### Laboratory and Biomarker Factors  
- **Glucose and Metabolic Markers:** As mentioned, admission hyperglycemia is a consistent predictor of early worsening. Hyperglycemia aggravates ischemic brain injury by multiple mechanisms (e.g., lactic acidosis). Intensive glucose control trials have not yet proven outcome benefit in acute stroke, but moderate control to avoid extreme hyperglycemia is advised. Elevated HbA1c (indicating chronic poor glycemic control) has also been associated with END ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=FACTORS%20W%20Wrong%20,2)), as captured in the WORSEN score (“W” for Wrong sugar control). Other metabolic factors have been explored: for example, one meta-analysis noted an association between higher *total cholesterol* and *triglyceride* levels with END risk ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=match%20at%20L227%20AIS,11%20END%20is%20also)). The exact relationship is complex – while chronic dyslipidemia predisposes to large artery disease, some studies paradoxically found lower cholesterol in END patients (possibly reflecting an acute phase response or malnutrition). At least one large cohort (Liu et al. 2023) identified elevated triglycerides as an independent predictor of END ([
            Early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a prospective multicenter cohort study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880581/#:~:text=of%20END%20occurred%20within%2024,as%20independent%20predictors%20for%20END)).  
- **Inflammatory Markers:** Growing evidence links systemic inflammation to stroke progression. *Leukocytosis* (high white blood cell count) on admission is a predictor of END ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=differences%20regarding%20demographic%20characteristics%2C%20other,were%20important%20predictors%20for%20END)) ([

Rashid et al. (2022) found that patients with END had significantly higher leukocyte counts than those without END ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=END%20was%20observed%20in%2020%2C,of%20mRS%20at%20day%2090)). Similarly, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) has been tied to early worsening; one study showed CRP as an independent predictor of END in AIS ([Identifying the Risk Factors of Early Neurological Deterioration After Thrombolysis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke | 2022, Volume 28 - Issue 3 |  Turkish Journal of Neurology](https://tjn.org.tr/full-text/92/eng#:~:text=15,is%20a%20predictor%20of%20early)). In the subacute period, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha) correlate with worse outcomes ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=were%20important%20predictors%20for%20END)), though their direct role in END is still under investigation. Biomarker research has identified dozens of candidates (e.g., NSE – neuron-specific enolase, a marker of neuronal injury – is higher in those who worsen) ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=were%20important%20predictors%20for%20END)), but no single biomarker has sufficient predictive value for routine use. It may be that a panel of inflammatory markers, or composite scores (like neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, NLR), could be useful. In fact, higher NLR has been associated with END in some studies ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=Proinflammatory%20cytokines%20are%20increased%20in,biomarkers%20for%20prognosis%20in%20AIS)).  
- **Coagulation Factors:** Elevated *fibrinogen* within the first day of stroke is linked with END, as it increases blood viscosity and thrombosis risk. A study by Castillo et al. (1997) reported that fibrinogen level was an independent predictor of early neurologic worsening, along with body temperature ([Body Temperature and Fibrinogen Are Related to Early ...](https://karger.com/ced/article/7/2/64/58920/Body-Temperature-and-Fibrinogen-Are-Related-to#:~:text=Body%20Temperature%20and%20Fibrinogen%20Are,%C2%B0C%20increase%20in%20body)). High fibrinogen can promote ongoing clot formation or vessel re-occlusion. Other hemostatic markers like D-dimer have been less studied but might indicate active thrombosis if elevated.  
- **Cardiac Biomarkers:** Some evidence suggests cardiac dysfunction biomarkers (e.g., NT-proBNP, troponin) relate to stroke outcomes. NT-proBNP (indicative of heart failure or atrial fibrillation burden) was noted to be higher in patients with END in one study ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=were%20important%20predictors%20for%20END)), aligning with the association of AF and large strokes with END. However, these markers are more firmly established for long-term prognosis rather than early deterioration.  

It is important to emphasize that no single risk factor guarantees END; rather, it is the combination of factors in an individual patient that determines risk. For example, an elderly patient with a high NIHSS, large artery occlusion, hyperglycemia, and leukocytosis is at very high risk for deterioration. In contrast, a younger patient with a small lacunar stroke and none of those risk factors has a low likelihood of END. Risk factors often interplay: large strokes cause more inflammation and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (raising WBC and temperature), and hyperglycemia worsens edema and hemorrhagic risk, etc. Table 2 categorizes major identified risk factors for END, with examples of supporting evidence.

Excessive BP reduction or hypotension can also precipitate END ([Early neurological deterioration in acute ischaemic stroke - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18832401/#:~:text=The%20clinical%20predictors%20of%20END,mellitus%2C%20hypotension%2C%20and%20atrial%20fibrillation)). Balance is needed. |
| **Fever (body temperature >37.5°C)**           | Clinical (physiological) | Early hyperthermia correlates with END; 1°C increase raises risk significantly ([Body Temperature and Fibrinogen Are Related to Early ...](https://karger.com/ced/article/7/2/64/58920/Body-Temperature-and-Fibrinogen-Are-Related-to#:~:text=Body%20Temperature%20and%20Fibrinogen%20Are,%C2%B0C%20increase%20in%20body)). Likely increases metabolic stress and infarct growth.                |
| **Large artery occlusion/stenosis** (e.g., ICA or proximal MCA) | Imaging (vascular) | Major cause of END due to ongoing ischemia. Large-artery stroke subtype had ~3.5-fold higher odds of END ([

May reflect large-artery disease burden. |
| **Cardiac markers (e.g., NT-proBNP)**        | Laboratory (cardiac) | NT-proBNP (indicator of AF or heart failure) was higher in END patients in one cohort ([

Not a well-established predictor, but related to cardioembolic risk. |

*Note:* This table highlights major factors repeatedly identified in literature. Importantly, the presence of any single factor does not guarantee END; risk is cumulative. For example, an elderly, hyperglycemic patient with a large artery occlusion and high WBC is at very high risk. These factors inform clinical vigilance – patients with multiple risk factors warrant close monitoring (e.g., in an intensive stroke unit setting) ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20findings%20of,close%20monitoring%20and%20rapid%20interventions)). Timely interventions addressing modifiable factors (fever control, glycemic control, blood pressure management, early reperfusion therapy) may help mitigate END risk.

## Prediction Models for END  
Given the clinical importance of END, numerous studies have attempted to develop predictive models or scoring systems to identify patients at risk for early deterioration. An ideal prediction model would combine multiple risk factors into a tool that clinicians can use at the bedside soon after stroke admission. Below we review the existing models and scores for END, including their inputs and performance. Table 3 provides a summary of key models, their predictors, and validation status.

**WORSEN Score:** One of the first scoring systems specifically developed for END is the **WORSEN score** by Miyamoto et al. (2017) ([            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=,DOI)). WORSEN is a mnemonic encompassing **W**rong (poor) glycemic control, **O**ld infarction (prior myocardial infarction as a marker of vascular disease), **R**adiologic evidence of proximal arterial occlusion, **S**ize of infarct, **E**levated LDL, and **N**eurologic deficit severity ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=FACTORS%20W%20Wrong%20,2)). Each component scores 1–3 points (for example, ICA occlusion = 3 points, MCA M1 occlusion = 2; NIHSS >8 = 2 points; etc.), with a total score range of 0–10 ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=FACTORS%20W%20Wrong%20,2)). The WORSEN score encapsulates many known risk factors: poor long-term glycemic control (HbA1c >7.4%), history of coronary artery disease (old MI), large vessel occlusion on imaging, moderate infarct size (>15 mm), high LDL cholesterol (>140 mg/dL), and initial NIHSS >8 ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=FACTORS%20W%20Wrong%20,2)). In the derivation study, WORSEN showed good discrimination for predicting END. Subsequent external validation in a Chinese cohort found that WORSEN had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of ~0.80 for predicting END ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=WORSEN%20score%20for%20the%20prediction,CI%200.78%E2%80%930.86%29%2C%20with%20a)). At an optimal cutoff (score ≥2), sensitivity was 62% and specificity 88% ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=WORSEN%20score%20for%20the%20prediction,CI%200.78%E2%80%930.86%29%2C%20with%20a)) ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=match%20at%20L419%20The%20area,NPV)). The AUC for predicting more severe END (defined as NIHSS increase ≥4) was similar (~0.82) ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=WORSEN%20score%20for%20the%20prediction,CI%200.78%E2%80%930.86%29%2C%20with%20a)). These performance metrics indicate the score is a reasonably accurate predictor, though not perfect. Notably, among various risk scores, WORSEN is unique as it was explicitly designed for END (as opposed to general stroke outcome) ([
            External Validation of the WORSEN Score for Prediction the Deterioration of Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population - PMC        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7272667/#:~:text=the%20WORSEN%20score%20was%20the,END%20in%20acute%20stroke%20patients)). However, it is not yet widely used in routine practice or incorporated into guidelines. Its complexity (requiring imaging and lab results) and moderate sensitivity may limit clinical uptake. Nonetheless, WORSEN highlights the multi-factorial nature of END risk and has been a reference point for later models.

**Nomogram and Regression-Based Models:** Several contemporary studies have employed multivariable regression or machine learning to create prediction models for END. These models typically generate a probability of END for a given patient based on a set of predictors. For instance, Xie et al. (2019) developed a model including initial NIHSS, MCA stenosis, and carotid stenosis, which could identify about 50% of patients who would develop END ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=been%20proposed%2C%20but%20none%20of,the%20risk%20of%20developing%20END)). This underscores the importance of intracranial large-vessel status in prediction. 

More recently, He et al. (2025) created a simplified **nomogram** for END after intravenous thrombolysis ([Frontiers | A predictive model for early neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1477286/full#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20we%20developed,model%20showed%20good%20discriminatory%20and)). Using LASSO logistic regression on a derivation cohort of thrombolyzed patients, they distilled the model down to **three predictors:** the NIHSS on admission, the *platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)*, and the *mean platelet volume (MPV)* ([Frontiers | A predictive model for early neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1477286/full#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20we%20developed,model%20showed%20good%20discriminatory%20and)). These two blood markers (PLR and MPV) reflect an inflammatory and platelet activation state, respectively, which were found to be among the most significant laboratory predictors in their analysis. The resulting nomogram assigns points for each of the three predictors and sums them to estimate END risk ([Frontiers | A predictive model for early neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1477286/full#:~:text=Figure%203,Finally%2C%20the%20risk%20of)). This model demonstrated high discriminative ability: in the training set, AUC = 0.896, and in an internal validation set, AUC = 0.901 ([Frontiers | A predictive model for early neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1477286/full#:~:text=The%20accuracy%20of%20the%20nomogram,for%20the%20validation%20set%2C%20which)). At the chosen cutoff, sensitivity was 84% and specificity 86% in training, and even higher sensitivity (96%) with ~75% specificity in validation ([Frontiers | A predictive model for early neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1477286/full#:~:text=The%20accuracy%20of%20the%20nomogram,for%20the%20validation%20set%2C%20which)). The model also showed good calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow p > 0.1) ([Frontiers | A predictive model for early neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2025.1477286/full#:~:text=The%20accuracy%20of%20the%20nomogram,for%20the%20validation%20set%2C%20which)). Such performance is promising, suggesting that combining clinical severity (NIHSS) with an inflammatory marker (PLR) and a platelet activation marker (MPV) can robustly predict early worsening in thrombolysis-treated patients. However, this nomogram has so far only been validated internally; external validation in other populations (and in non-thrombolyzed patients) will be needed before broad adoption. It is noteworthy for using easily obtainable variables and achieving high accuracy, pointing toward the potential of simple scoring based on key pathophysiological processes (neurologic injury severity + inflammation/thrombosis).  

Another example is a **nomogram by Yi et al. (2020)** in a general AIS cohort (published in *European Journal of Neurology*), which similarly incorporated clinical and imaging factors to predict END ([Predictive Modeling of Early Neurological Deterioration in Patients ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875024013767#:~:text=Predictive%20Modeling%20of%20Early%20Neurological,deterioration%20in%20acute%20ischemic%20stroke)). While the detailed inputs of that model are beyond this review, it reportedly achieved an AUC in the ~0.80 range and was presented as a user-friendly tool (nomogram) for clinicians ([Predictive Modeling of Early Neurological Deterioration in Patients ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875024013767#:~:text=Predictive%20Modeling%20of%20Early%20Neurological,deterioration%20in%20acute%20ischemic%20stroke)). 

**Specialized Scores for Specific Subgroups:** Some prediction models focus on particular stroke subgroups or treatment contexts. For instance, a JAMA Neurology study (Sylaja et al., 2021) derived a score to predict END in *minor stroke with large vessel occlusion* patients who are potential candidates for thrombolysis ([Prediction of Early Neurological Deterioration in ... - EBSCOhost](https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=21686149&AN=149242645&h=WWPCjcTt5GM07ezjIXewFmogb%2B2C4DU0H43SjW%2BPiquV7%2B4Tii6lbv71Mo9LFBs24%2FcoPvRTQH43WmOiq0EiZg%3D%3D&crl=f#:~:text=EBSCOhost%20search,March%202021%20Volume%2078)). The goal was to identify which mild stroke patients might rapidly worsen due to an occlusion and thus benefit from acute therapy. That score included factors like occlusion location and collateral status and provided a risk estimate for deterioration despite low initial NIHSS. In another domain, scores have been proposed to predict END after *mechanical thrombectomy* for large vessel strokes. Since early neurological worsening after thrombectomy can occur (due to hemorrhagic transformation, edema, or re-occlusion), one study developed an interpretable machine learning model for post-thrombectomy END risk ([Post-thrombolysis early neurological deterioration occurs with or ...](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(23)02827-X#:~:text=,the%20deterioration%20of%20acute)). This ML model incorporated procedural factors and patient characteristics, and while it showed moderate-to-good predictive performance, it remains in research stages. 

Overall, numerous predictive models exist, but as of now **no model has entered routine clinical use or guideline recommendations** ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=Many%20authors%20have%20called%20for,the%20risk%20of%20developing%20END)). Many are single-center or derivation studies without broad validation. END prediction is challenging in part because of the need to integrate diverse data (clinical, imaging, lab). Simpler risk scores like WORSEN are easier to apply but may miss cases (sensitivity ~60%), whereas complex models or ML might overfit or be less generalizable. There is also overlap between END prediction and stroke outcome prediction – since an early deterioration often signals a poor outcome, some outcome scores implicitly capture END risk. However, a dedicated tool for END is valuable for triaging intensive monitoring and proactive interventions (e.g., blood pressure management, early surgery for malignant edema, etc.). The consensus in recent literature is that combining modalities (clinical + imaging + biomarkers) yields the best predictive power ([

*Note:* Many models above have been developed, but none is universally adopted in practice ([
            Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration and Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Importance of Large Artery Disease, Hyperglycemia and Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464020/#:~:text=Many%20authors%20have%20called%20for,the%20risk%20of%20developing%20END)). Simpler scores like WORSEN are notable for being specifically tailored to END, whereas others (nomograms, ML models) show improved accuracy but need broader validation. A common theme is that combining **clinical severity**, **vascular imaging**, and **biomarker data** yields the best predictive power. Future efforts may integrate real-time data (e.g., perfusion imaging, continuous vital signs monitoring) into prediction algorithms for END. For now, clinicians should be aware of major risk factors and use clinical judgment to identify high-risk patients, while research continues to refine predictive tools.
